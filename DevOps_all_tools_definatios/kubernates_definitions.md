Kubernetes:
----------- 
 * It is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

Pods:
----
 * The smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model, a single instance of a running process.

Nodes: 
------
 * Physical or virtual machines that run the containers.

Services:
---------
 * A logical abstraction that defines a set of Pods and a policy by which to access them, allowing for load balancing and networking.

Replication Controllers:
------------------------
 * Ensure that a specified number of replicas of a Pod are running at any given time.

Labels:
-------
 * Key-value pairs attached to objects, such as Pods, used to organize and to select subsets of objects.

ConfigMaps and Secrets:
-----------------------
 * Store configuration data and sensitive information, respectively, that can be made available to the Pods.

Volumes:
--------
 * A mechanism to persist data generated by and used by a Pod across its lifetime.

Namespaces:
-----------
 * Virtual clusters within a physical cluster, used to partition resources and allocate access.

Deployments:
------------
 * Describe and manage the desired state of application instances, including desired number of replicas, updates, and rollbacks.

StatefulSets:
------------- 
 * Similar to Deployments, but for stateful applications that require unique network identities and persistent storage.
