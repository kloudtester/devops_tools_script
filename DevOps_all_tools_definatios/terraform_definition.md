Terraform: An open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently using declarative code.
Providers: Plugins for Terraform that interact with specific service providers, such as AWS or Google Cloud.

Resources: Represent components of the infrastructure, such as virtual machines, DNS entries, databases, etc.

Modules: Reusable packages of Terraform configuration, used to organize and share infrastructure code.

Variables: Inputs to Terraform configuration, used to parameterize and customize infrastructure.

Outputs: Declarations of values that will be surfaced after Terraform runs, often used to export data to other tools or workflows.

State: Representation of the infrastructure managed by Terraform, stored in a state file and used to track changes over time.

Data Sources: Components that provide data to be used within Terraform configuration, such as information about existing resources.

Provisioners: Components that run custom scripts or configuration management tools after Terraform creates resources.

Workspaces: Isolated instances of Terraform configuration, used to manage multiple environments within a single Terraform state.
