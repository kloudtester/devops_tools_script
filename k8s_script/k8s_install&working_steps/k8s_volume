when we want to create any storage in k8s there are some types
       * volume
       * Ephemeral volume
       * persistent volume
Volume:
this volume is depend on the lifecycle of pod
Ephemeral volume:
this also temporary volume used for container require any persistent volume when they restart or create 
the volume will be same .
it is only present when pod is running
persistent volume:
it is another type of volume which is not depend on the lifecycle of pod 
it uses the storage classes of azure or aws 
when we claim any storage class in any cloud that will managaes the storage 
it is automatically craeated cloud controller <when we use k8s as a services>
if we use manual k8s config <we have to assign it>
