* after use this command to start the elasticsearch
* sudo systemctl daemon-reload
* sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
* sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
* lets use this curl command to access the elasticsearch
* curl --insecure -u <username>:<we have to give the password> that was present in the above file https://localhost:9200
* elasticsearch port number is 9200
* if we done all good then u will recive this response

* now install kibana use this command <if we going to install kibana on the vm where the elasticsearch is present>
* sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kibana
* after this we want to generate the token for kibana<command is present in the above file>
* sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana 
* kibana port is 5601
* then it will generate the token and palce that token in the /etc/kibana/kibana.yml file
* change server.host "<0.0.0.0>"
* after apply this command again
* sudo systemctl daemon-reload
* sudo systemctl enable kibana.service
* sudo systemctl start kibana.service
* after generate the verfication token <type whereis kibana> then it will show the kibana path then enter into bin folder
