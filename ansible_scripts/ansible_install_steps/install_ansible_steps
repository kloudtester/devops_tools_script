Ansible installing steps:

1.fisrt we have to create 2 vms and create user with password in both vm (use same users in both vms)
2.next give the sudoers permission to that user in both vms 
3.next choose one and install ansible in that vm by using using this command
--- 
sudo apt -y install software-properties-common -y
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible -y
sudo apt install ansible -y
---
4.next add same user in both master and node
     * sudo adduser <username>
     * sudo visudo <sai ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL> this step will give under sudo 
     * sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config <enable password authentication to yes>
     * sudo systemctl restart sshd
5.next in master vm create hosts file it also called as inventry file and add content 2 vm private ip and save the file and login by using created user 
     * command: ssh <created username@master vm publicip>
6.next generate the ssh key in master vm by using this command 
     * ssh-keygen 
7.copy the generated ssh key to 2 vm by using this command 
     * ssh-copy-id <username@privateip of 2 vm>
8.next check master is talking with workernode by using this command 
     * ansible -i hosts -m ping all (or) -k all 
9.next try to connect the 2 vm through master vm by using this command 
     * ssh <created user>@workernode privateip



Creating playbook in ansible:


1.first create file with extesion of .yml (or) .yaml
2.for example if you want to install apache2 in ubuntu this is the playbook 
 
  - name: basic_file
    become: yes
    hosts: all
    tasks: 
      - name: installing apache2
        ansible.builtin.apt:
          name: apache2
          state: present
3.here we the module apt beacuse ubuntu is use the apt package repo so we are using apt module <ansible.builtin.apt:> after this module name must be equal to u installing package name 
4.after creating the playbook file first use this command to check the syntax
    * ansible-playbook -i hosts --syntax-check <playbook file name>
